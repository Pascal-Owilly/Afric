This way, the aim is to bring the nutrients closer to the roots to assimilate more quickly.</p></Card>

     <Card className="enterprise-card">  <p>Its purpose is to quickly make primary nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium available to the plant.

On many occasions, the nutrients are very fixated on the soil, and the crops do not assimilate them, so this application always corrects the deficiencies.

Foliar fertilizers on plants, are applied as mists, sprays and/or drenches. The leaves then absorb them. When foliar is absorbed, its effects are appreciated very quickly.</p></Card>
